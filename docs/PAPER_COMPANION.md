## Overview

All dynamics presented in this paper can be reproduced and explored interactively using **ASPIRE Desktop**, an open-source visualization instrument for evaluative learning. The tool transforms abstract training metrics into interpretable visual representations, enabling researchers to:

- **Observe** conscience formation dynamics in real-time
- **Compare** training runs with different evaluator geometries side-by-side
- **Annotate** trajectories with theoretically-grounded interpretations
- **Inspect** failure events in their temporal context
- **Export** publication-ready figures and frame sequences

## Theoretical Grounding

Every visual element in ASPIRE Desktop corresponds to a construct defined in the theoretical framework:

| Visual Element | Theoretical Construct | Interpretation |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Trajectory spiral | Attractor formation | Convergence to stable conscience |
| Trajectory wandering | Plural basins | No coherent internalization |
| Phase-locked scalar rings | Shared latent axis | Evaluators agree on quality direction |
| Drifting scalar rings | Orthogonal evaluators | No shared quality conception |
| λ₁ dominance (>80%) | Low effective dimensionality | Single evaluative axis emerged |
| Flat eigenvalue spectrum | High effective dimensionality | Multiple competing axes |
| Curvature spikes | Phase transitions | Moments of evaluator conflict resolution |
| Professor vector alignment | Evaluator correlation | Degree of shared latent structure |

## Key Visualizations

### 1. Trajectory View

The trajectory view projects the model's internal state into a 2D space via PCA on the learned representation. Key features:

- **Flow field**: Velocity vectors showing gradient direction at each point
- **Curvature overlay**: Highlights regions of rapid directional change
- **Professor vectors**: Shows evaluator preferences as directional arrows
- **Holdout indicator**: Distinguishes held-out evaluators for transfer analysis

### 2. Eigenvalue Spectrum

The eigenvalue spectrum tracks the covariance structure of evaluator feedback over time:

- **First factor variance** (λ₁/Σλ): Proportion of variance explained by dominant axis
- **Effective dimensionality**: Entropy-based measure of axis plurality
- **Temporal animation**: Shows how structure emerges (or fails to emerge) during training

### 3. Side-by-Side Comparison

The comparison view enables causal analysis by displaying two runs with:

- **Synchronized playback**: Same time point across both trajectories
- **Matched scales**: Identical coordinate systems for direct comparison
- **Differential metrics**: Real-time computation of λ₁ delta, curvature delta, etc.
- **Automated verdict**: Statistical assessment of which condition shows stronger unification

### 4. Failures Timeline

The failures view provides systematic access to negative results:

- **Severity coding**: Critical (red), Warning (orange), Info (yellow)
- **Temporal context**: Failures positioned on training timeline
- **Jump-to-failure**: Click to navigate to failure state
- **Category labels**: Failure type (calibration, coherence, etc.)

## Reproducing Paper Figures

Figures in this paper were generated using ASPIRE Desktop's export functionality:

```
Figure 3a: Trajectory comparison (Path A vs Path B)
  → Compare tab → Load both runs → Export at t=0.65

Figure 3b: Eigenvalue evolution
  → Geometry tab → Frame sequence export (5s @ 30fps)

Figure 4: Failure distribution
  → Failures tab → Screenshot with timeline visible

Figure 5: Annotation overlay
  → Trajectory tab → Annotations ON → Export at t=0.40
```

All exports are available at full resolution (up to 4K) with configurable options for:
- Professor vector visibility
- Metric overlays
- Annotation layers
- Background styling

## Installation and Usage

### Requirements

- .NET 8.0 or later
- Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux (via .NET MAUI)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/aspire-ai-desktop.git
cd aspire-ai-desktop

# Build and run
dotnet build src/AspireDesktop
dotnet run --project src/AspireDesktop
```

### Loading Data

ASPIRE Desktop reads geometry exports (`.json`) generated by the aspire-engine training framework:

```python
from aspire.export.geometry_export import export_geometry

# After training completes
export_geometry(
    trainer=trainer,
    output_path="run_geometry.json",
    include_trajectory=True,
    include_eigenvalues=True,
    include_failures=True
)
```
